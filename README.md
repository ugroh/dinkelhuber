# 9x9 Go Opening explorer
I created the first big 9x9 go opening explorer from ca. 200k OGS games. You can find a working version of the explorer in the internet on [go.yannikkeller.de](http://go.yannikkeller.de/), but you won't be able to use it, because you don't know my super secret password. Muhahahaha.

I might make the explorer public at some point, but first I need to reach 1 dan on OGS. Until that you will have to wait I guess ;)
